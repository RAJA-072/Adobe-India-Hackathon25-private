# Adobe India Hackathon 2025 🏆

## Welcome to the "Connecting the Dots" Challenge

### Rethink Reading. Rediscover Knowledge - MISSION ACCOMPLISHED! ✅

What if every time you opened a PDF, it didn't just sit there—it spoke to you, connected ideas, and narrated meaning across your entire library?

**We've built that future** — and delivered winning hackathon solutions that redefine PDF intelligence.

In the Connecting the Dots Challenge, we've reimagined the humble PDF as an intelligent, interactive experience—one that understands structure, surfaces insights, and responds with AI-powered precision like a trusted research companion.
